why do people have weak curiosity ? why do interesting people are left unreconized and shallow people get to think they
are special and know how to live ? honestly i dont really know but i think it's because we are survival based creatures
we are drawn to the simplest ways and most boring repetitive patterns we as humans are boring by nature and we use language
to hide how boring we are and that's why most secrets are never revealed most special people will remain unkown and no one
will ever care
